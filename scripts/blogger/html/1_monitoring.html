<h3>cool title bro</h3>

<p>Here is a sample blog post. This could be something like a long intro paragraph that has some intro stuff. like what is it all about really? Let me tell you cuz I know.</p>

<h5>this would be a header</h5>

<p>So here is the first paragraph and I&rsquo;ll get into some juicy deails right off the bat. Take a look at this stuff below here. Here is a code snippet:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">package helpers

import (
	&quot;net/http&quot;
)

func GetIpAddr(r *http.Request) string {
	// default to using custom set header
	ip := r.Header.Get(&quot;AK-First-External-IP&quot;)
	if ip != &quot;&quot; {
		return ip
	}

	// if above fails for some reason, use RemnoteAddr
	// note, that will just be the ip of the nginx reverse proxy
	ip = r.RemoteAddr
	return ip
}
</code></pre>

<h5>another one</h5>

<p>And now here&rsquo;s some more cool stuff to wet your eyeballs. Here is a sample <a href="/home/myshkins/pics/synced_pics/selfie.jpeg">image</a>, showing me.</p>
