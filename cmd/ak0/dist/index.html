      Work In Progress! An exercise in all things front end. I wanted to show 
      the world that I too can center a div. jk. This was more about learning 
      how to build an SPA that's responsive, server side generated, and (at 
      least somewhat) nice looking. I based this fictional coffee shop website 
      loosely on Blue Bottle Coffee's website. Next steps are to add more pages 
      and a guest user login. But, hey, in the meantime, stop on by this cute 
      <a href="https://jupiter.ak0.io">lil internet cafe</a>, 
      and grab yourself a fancy $20 coffee. It'll be a nice experience for you 
      on any device. And here's the

      I thought it might be interesting to share a little about the monitoring 
      that I have set up for this site. I did a lot more than was necessary 
      just for the the sake of learning, and I'm planning on writing a blog 
      post about how I set everything up, but here's a brief overview. This 
      site is a simple webapp written in Go, and I instrumented it with 
      Opentelemetry to collect http metrics. I'm using docker compose to run my 
      webapp, an Opentelemetry collector, a Prometheus backend, and a Grafana 
      instance. I've set up view only access for my grafana dashboard 
      <a href="/grafana/d/eeer2i27cwm4gb/ak0-overview%3ForgId%3D1%26from%3Dnow-24h%26to%3Dnow%26timezone%3Dbrowser"{GRAFANA_URL}>here</a>.

      *NOTE: the site is not live unfortunately, for cost saving reasons. Please 
      check out the github repo.<br>My brother and I wanted to collaborate on a 
      project, and us both being environmentalists at heart, we decided to 
      build an air quality monitoring app. The end goal is to create a platform 
      where users can compare air quality measurements they personally took with 
      air quality data provided by government agencies. We first started with 
      building the data pipeline and data visualization tool that you see 
      linked here. We used Apache Airflow to orchestrate our ELT data pipeline. 
      Our api is built with FastAPI, and the front end is rendered with React.

      for this project.

    I built a blog for recording all of the things I learn as I develop 
    projects. It's build with Flask, Postgres, and SQLAlchemy, and it's deployed 
    with Nginx, Gunicorn, and Docker. Check out the site

      *NOTE: No current temperature data for this project, but the site is up 
      :/<br>The inspiration for this project came from Chancho the chinchilla. 
      He's a 15 year old chinchilla who is very particular about the climate 
      around him. Chinchillas generally don't tolerate temperatures outside the 
      range of 60-75 degrees Farenheit. Thus, I created this app as a way to 
      monitor the temperature of the apartment when my partner and I are away. 
      I used a Raspberry Pi with a temperature sensor to get the temperature 
      data, which is then posted to my database via my api. The app then pulls 
      the data to render a webpage with a view of the data. The tech stack 
      includes Go, Gin, MYSQL, Docker, and Nginx. It's deployed on my personal 
      VPS. Click

      to see the app, or the 
      <a href="https://github.com/myshkins/gopetwatch">Github repo</a>

      Here is a fun little drawing app created with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. 
      In this app a user only needs to move their mouse to draw on the screen. 
      Users can also choose the dimensions of the grid (ie. the resolution), as 
      well as the color of the pen. Clicking the rainbow button allows the pen 
      or the grid to be drawn in a rainbow of colors. Click
