# Worker Nodes
#
# Kubernetes uses a [special-purpose authorization mode](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/node/)
# called Node Authorizer, that specifically authorizes API requests made
# by [Kubelets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kubelet).
# In order to be authorized by the Node Authorizer, Kubelets must use a credential
# that identifies them as being in the `system:nodes` group, with a username
# of `system:node:<nodeName>`.
